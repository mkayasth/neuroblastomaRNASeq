Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer occuring in neuroblasts. It is the most common extracranial solid tumor diagnosed in children. There are 3 different Neuroblastoma phenotypes based on the telomere maintenance mechanism: ALT, Telomerase and No TMM.

In this project, signature genes for ALT phenotype are identified using single cell RNA seq expression (counts) data. The survival probability of different phenotypes are also compared.
